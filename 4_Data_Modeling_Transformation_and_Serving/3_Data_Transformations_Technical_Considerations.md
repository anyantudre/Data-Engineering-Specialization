# Data Transformations and Technical Considerations  
*A structured overview of batch, distributed, and streaming data transformation frameworks and their practical implications.*  

## Introduction  
Data transformation is a cornerstone of modern data engineering, bridging the gap between raw data ingestion and actionable insights. This chapter explores the technical considerations behind batch, distributed, and streaming transformations, and introduces key tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Amazon EMR, and AWS Glue. We also look into Spark DataFrames, Spark SQL, and the role of ETL/ELT in real-world pipelines. By understanding these approaches and frameworks, data engineers can make informed choices about scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Batch Transformation Patterns and Use Cases  
Batch transformations involve processing discrete chunks of data on fixed schedules (daily, hourly, or even every few minutes). They are widely used in analytics pipelines and for preparing datasets for machine learning.  

### Core Approaches:  
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Transform data externally before loading it into the warehouse. Example: using **AWS Glue ETL** with Spark for distributed transformations.  
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):** Load raw data first, then transform it directly inside the data warehouse using tools like **DBT**.  
- **EtLT (Hybrid):** Apply light cleaning before loading, then perform deeper transformations in the warehouse.  

### Data Wrangling:  
Raw data often contains **missing values, duplicates, or outliers**. Data wrangling tools (e.g., **AWS Glue DataBrew**) automate cleaning and normalization, avoiding manual “heavy lifting.”  

### Updating Pipelines:  
- **Truncate and reload:** Simple but inefficient for large datasets.  
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Updates only based on changes, tracked through timestamps or transaction logs.  

Patterns for handling changes:  
- **Insert-only:** Append new records without modifying old ones.  
- **Upsert/Merge:** Replace records when keys match; insert otherwise.  
- **Hard delete vs. Soft delete:** Permanent removal vs. marking records as inactive.  

**Note:** Avoid single-row inserts in OLAP columnar databases, as this is inefficient. Instead, use **micro-batches** to optimize compression and query performance.

## Distributed Processing Framework – Hadoop  
Hadoop, born in the mid-2000s, was inspired by Google’s **GFS** (Google File System) and **MapReduce** papers.  

- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):** Stores data across nodes with replication for durability and availability.  
- **MapReduce:** Executes computation where the data resides, minimizing transfer. It follows a three-phase model:  
  1. **Map:** Process individual blocks into key-value pairs.  
  2. **Shuffle:** Redistribute keys across nodes.  
  3. **Reduce:** Aggregate results per key.  

**Limitations:**  
- Heavy reliance on disk I/O.  
- Lack of in-memory caching, leading to slower performance compared to modern systems.  

Despite being less popular today, Hadoop laid the foundation for newer frameworks like Spark.

## Distributed Processing Framework – Spark  
Spark emerged in 2009 as a faster, more flexible alternative to Hadoop MapReduce.  

### Key Features:  
- **In-memory computation** reduces reliance on disk.  
- **Unified platform:** Supports SQL, machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and streaming.  
- **Language support:** Python (PySpark), Scala, Java, and R.  

### Architecture:  
- **Driver node:** Translates code into jobs and execution plans (DAGs).  
- **Cluster manager:** Allocates resources.  
- **Worker nodes:** Run tasks in parallel through executors.  

This DAG-based execution ensures parallelism and efficient job scheduling.  

---

## Spark DataFrames  
Spark DataFrames abstract away low-level **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**, allowing high-level operations on distributed tabular data.  

- **Immutable:** Once created, cannot be modified.  
- **Transformations vs. Actions:**  
  - Transformations (lazy evaluation): `select`, `filter`, `groupBy`.  
  - Actions (trigger execution): `show`, `count`, `save`.  
- **Fault tolerance:** Achieved via lineage tracking, allowing recomputation after failures.  

This design combines **expressiveness (SQL-like operations)** with **scalability**.  

---

## Demo: Working with Spark DataFrames Using Python  
Using **PySpark**, engineers can manipulate distributed data with familiar Python syntax.  

### Example workflow:  
1. **Initialize Spark Session:**  
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("example").getOrCreate()
````

*(Creates a session to manage Spark applications.)*

2. **Create DataFrames:**

   ```python
   data = [(1, "Apple", 3), (2, "Banana", 5)]
   df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["id", "fruit", "quantity"])
   df.show()
   ```

3. **Transformations:** Add a computed column.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col
   df = df.withColumn("double_qty", col("quantity") * 2)
   ```

4. **Aggregations:**

   ```python
   df.groupBy("fruit").sum("quantity").show()
   ```

**Caution:** Python UDFs can be slower due to JVM ↔ Python serialization overhead. For performance, prefer native Spark SQL functions or Scala/Java UDFs.

---

## Demo: Working with Spark SQL

Spark also supports SQL queries on DataFrames via **temporary views**:

```python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("orders")
spark.sql("SELECT fruit, SUM(quantity) FROM orders GROUP BY fruit").show()
```

This approach is especially useful for teams familiar with SQL, enabling seamless integration of **user-defined functions (UDFs)** and **joins** across multiple views.

## Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) provides a **managed cluster environment** for distributed frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and Flink.

### Key Features:

* **Elastic scaling:** Dynamically scale clusters based on workload.
* **Decoupled compute and storage:** Integrates with **Amazon S3** for persistence.
* **AWS ecosystem integration:** Works with Redshift, DynamoDB, and RDS.

Example: Running a PySpark script on EMR to compute **average taxi fares** from S3 data. This demonstrates EMR’s ability to combine **managed infrastructure** with **big data frameworks** for faster time-to-insight.

## AWS Glue Overview

AWS Glue is a **serverless ETL service** powered by Spark. It helps unify and transform data from diverse sources into analytics-ready formats.

### Options for Building ETL Jobs:

1. **Glue DataBrew:** No-code, spreadsheet-like UI for cleaning and preparation.
2. **Glue Studio:** Visual interface with drag-and-drop for ETL workflows.
3. **Jupyter Notebooks with PySpark:** Full control with custom Spark code.

Glue’s **Data Catalog** enables metadata management, schema discovery, and integration with **Athena, QuickSight, and SageMaker**.

---

## Demo: AWS Glue Visual ETL

Using Glue Studio, engineers can visually define **sources, transformations, and targets** for ETL jobs.

Example pipeline:

* **Source:** Extract data from **Amazon RDS** (MySQL).
* **Transform:** Convert normalized schema into a **star schema** using SQL queries.
* **Target:** Load results into **Amazon S3** in Parquet format.

Glue automatically generates the underlying PySpark script, allowing engineers to refine or extend transformations as needed.

---

## Technical Considerations

When deciding between **Spark SQL** and **Python DataFrames**, consider:

* **Complexity:** SQL is simpler for filtering and grouping, while Python is better for complex logic (e.g., transpose operations).
* **Reusability:** Python allows modular code; SQL queries are harder to reuse at scale.
* **Team skills:** SQL may be more accessible for analysts, Python for engineers.

**Pandas vs. Spark:**

* Use **Pandas** for small datasets that fit in memory.
* Use **Spark** for large-scale, distributed processing.

**Best practice:** Extract only the required data before transformations to optimize performance and resource usage.

---

## Streaming Processing

Streaming transformations handle continuous event flows, enabling **real-time analytics**.

### Examples:

* **IoT enrichment:** Add device metadata to raw events.
* **Window functions:** Compute rolling aggregates over time.
* **Joins:** Combine website clickstreams with IoT data for unified insights.

### Tools:

* **Spark Streaming (micro-batching):** Processes small batches every few seconds.
* **Apache Flink (true streaming):** Processes events one at a time with lower latency.

**Trade-off:**

* **Micro-batches:** Simpler, efficient for moderate latency needs.
* **True streaming:** Necessary for ultra-low latency use cases (e.g., fraud detection).
