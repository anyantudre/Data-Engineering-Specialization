# Data Modeling and Transformations for Machine Learning  

### Preparing tabular, image, and text data for effective machine learning applications  

Machine learning projects depend on carefully structured and transformed data. Unlike analytics-focused modeling, data modeling for ML aims to prepare datasets that algorithms can directly consume for training, validation, and deployment. This chapter explores the **machine learning project lifecycle**, clarifies the data engineer’s role, and details how to prepare tabular, image, and text data. Topics include **feature engineering, scaling, encoding, handling missing values, image preprocessing, and text vectorization or embeddings**. Practical demos with **Scikit-learn** illustrate how to transform raw data into training-ready datasets. The chapter concludes with a summary that integrates these concepts into the broader practice of data engineering for machine learning.

## Overview  

Data modeling for machine learning is not about designing schemas for storage but about **structuring data for algorithms**. Data engineers play a vital role in:  

- **Collecting and combining** data from multiple sources.  
- **Cleaning and converting** data into algorithm-friendly formats.  
- **Engineering features** to enhance model accuracy.  
- **Delivering prepared datasets** to ML engineers and data scientists.  

Machine learning projects follow iterative phases: scoping, data collection/preparation, algorithm development, and deployment. Data engineers may serve raw data, processed features, or even handle featurization, depending on organizational maturity. High-quality data preparation directly impacts model performance—**garbage in, garbage out** remains a fundamental principle.

## Machine Learning Overview  

Machine learning approaches fall into **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.  

- **Supervised learning** uses historical labeled data. Examples:  
  - *Classification*: predicting churn (label = churned or not).  
  - *Regression*: forecasting sales (label = numerical value).  
- **Unsupervised learning** works without labels, such as customer segmentation.  

### Lifecycle Phases:  
1. **Scoping** – define the ML problem.  
2. **Data phase** – collect, label, and organize features/labels.  
3. **Algorithm development** – train and test models (classical ML, neural networks, or LLMs).  
4. **Deployment** – integrate, monitor, and retrain systems.  

Data engineers primarily support the **data phase**, but may also maintain pipelines that refresh and serve data to deployed systems.

## Modeling Data for Traditional ML Algorithms  

Classical ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) typically require **numerical tabular data**. Preparing such data involves:  

1. **Handling missing values**  
   - Drop rows/columns (if safe).  
   - Impute with mean/median or similar records.  

2. **Feature scaling**  
   - **Standardization**:  
     \[
     z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
     \]  
     Produces mean = 0, variance = 1.  
   - **Min-max scaling**:  
     \[
     x' = \frac{x - \min}{\max - \min}
     \]  
     Rescales values into [0,1].  

3. **Encoding categorical variables**  
   - **One-hot encoding**: creates binary columns.  
   - **Ordinal encoding**: assigns integers when categories have natural order.  
   - Alternatives: hashing, embeddings.  

4. **Feature engineering**  
   - Example: purchases per minute = total purchases ÷ time on platform.  

These steps ensure the dataset is fully numerical, balanced, and optimized for algorithmic processing.

## Demo: Processing Tabular Data with Scikit-Learn (Part 1)  

In practice, libraries like **Scikit-learn** streamline preprocessing.  

- Example dataset: customer churn (≈440,000 rows, 11 columns).  
- Workflow:  
  - Explore dataset using `pandas` (`head()`, `describe()`, `isnull()`).  
  - Handle missing values (drop or impute).  
  - Explore categorical variables with `value_counts()`.  
  - Split dataset into **features (X)** and **labels (y)**.  
  - Partition data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.  

This structured preparation enables consistent application of scaling and encoding steps, later automated with Scikit-learn pipelines.

## Demo: Processing Tabular Data with Scikit-Learn (Part 2)  

Step-by-step preprocessing using Scikit-learn:  

1. **Split dataset**  
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
````

2. **Scale numerical columns**

   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[numerical_cols])
   X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test[numerical_cols])
   ```

   > Standardization ensures numerical features lie within comparable ranges.

3. **Encode categorical columns**

   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
   encoder = OneHotEncoder()
   X_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_train[categorical_cols]).toarray()
   X_test_encoded = encoder.transform(X_test[categorical_cols]).toarray()
   ```

   > One-hot encoding expands categories into binary vectors.

4. **Recombine and save**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   X_train_final = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled), pd.DataFrame(X_train_encoded)], axis=1)
   X_train_final.to_parquet("train.parquet")
   ```

   > Final datasets are stored as **Parquet files**, ready for ML training.

## Modeling Image Data for ML Algorithms

Image-based ML tasks include **classification, object detection, and segmentation**.

* **Classical ML approach**: flatten image pixels into vectors → tabular form.

  * Limitations: loss of spatial structure, very high dimensionality.
* **Deep learning approach**: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** process images directly.

  * Early layers: detect edges and textures.
  * Later layers: capture task-specific features.
  * Commonly fine-tuned from pre-trained CNNs.

### Preprocessing tasks:

* Resize images to expected dimensions.
* Normalize pixel values (e.g., scale to \[0,1]).
* Data augmentation: flipping, rotation, cropping, brightness adjustment.

Frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** provide built-in preprocessing utilities.

## Preprocessing Texts for Analysis and Text Classification

Text data is abundant (reviews, social posts, chat logs) and often messy. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques transform text into ML-ready input.

### Preprocessing steps:

1. **Cleaning** – remove punctuation, extra spaces, irrelevant characters.
2. **Normalization** – lowercase text, expand contractions, unify units/acronyms.
3. **Tokenization** – split sentences into words or subwords.
4. **Stop word removal** – discard common, low-information words (“the”, “is”).
5. **Lemmatization** – reduce words to base forms (e.g., “running” → “run”).

Classical ML requires preprocessed text in **numerical vector form**, while modern **LLMs** can often process tokenized raw text directly. However, pre-processing still improves efficiency and quality.

## Text Vectorization and Embedding

To use text with ML models, transform words/sentences into vectors.

### Traditional approaches:

* **Bag of Words (BoW)** – counts word frequency per document.
* **TF-IDF** – weighs word importance by rarity across the corpus.

Example:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_bow = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
```

> BoW and TF-IDF are interpretable but high-dimensional and sparse.

### Modern approaches:

* **Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)** – map words with similar meanings to nearby vectors.
* **Sentence embeddings** – capture semantic meaning of entire sentences.

Example with **Sentence Transformers**:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(["This product is great!", "I love the price."])
```

> Output vectors can be used for similarity search, clustering, or classification.
