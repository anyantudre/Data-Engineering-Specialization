# Serving Data in Modern Data Engineering  
*From files to real-time streams: strategies and best practices for delivering trusted data to end users.*  

## Introduction  
Serving data is the final stage in the data engineering lifecycle, where prepared datasets are delivered to analysts, data scientists, and applications. This chapter explores different approaches to serving data for analytics and machine learning, from simple file sharing to sophisticated real-time pipelines. It also covers database views, materialized views, and the importance of semantic layers for consistency and trust. Finally, the chapter concludes with a reflection on the entire program’s key concepts, offering guidance on how data engineers can continue evolving their skills and adapt to new trends in the field.

## Serving Data for Analytics and Machine Learning  
There are multiple ways to serve data depending on the needs of your stakeholders and the nature of the workload.  

### File-based sharing  
- **Direct file sharing:** Analysts may request CSVs, data scientists might need text files, and ML engineers could require image files. While straightforward, emailing files introduces versioning issues and does not scale.  
- **Object storage and data lakes:** Semi-structured or unstructured data is better served via cloud object storage or a data lake, enabling larger-scale sharing and persistence.  

### Databases and warehouses  
- **OLAP databases:** Analysts can query structured data directly using SQL, gaining benefits such as schema enforcement, fine-grained access controls, and high-performance query engines.  
- **Operational analytics databases:** Combine features of OLAP systems with stream processing to deliver low-latency queries over both historical and up-to-date streaming data.  

### Data management and semantics  
Ensuring trust and consistency is critical:  
- **Data definitions:** Shared organizational meaning of terms (e.g., what constitutes a “customer”).  
- **Data logic:** Standardized formulas (e.g., customer lifetime value) to avoid redundant or inconsistent SQL.  
- **Semantic layer:** A translation layer (via BI tools or DBT) that maps technical structures to business-friendly concepts.  

### End-user tools  
- **Analytics dashboards:** BI platforms like Amazon QuickSight, Looker, or Apache Superset.  
- **Data science platforms:** Jupyter notebooks, or cloud ML services such as SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Azure ML.

## Views and Materialized Views  
Databases offer **views** and **materialized views** as mechanisms to simplify access, enforce security, and optimize performance.  

### Views  
A **view** is a stored query acting as a virtual table:  
```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_info AS
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email, a.phone, a.address
FROM customer c
JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id;
````

This query simplifies repeated joins for analysts. Views also enable column/row-level security by exposing only necessary subsets of data. Unlike **CTEs (common table expressions)**, which are temporary and scoped to a single query, views persist as database objects until explicitly dropped.

**Limitation:** Each time a view is queried, the underlying SQL is executed again, potentially leading to performance costs.

### Materialized Views

Materialized views precompute and cache results:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rental_by_category AS
SELECT c.name AS category_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_payments
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

* Results are stored physically, reducing query time for complex joins.
* Data can be **refreshed periodically**, introducing some latency but improving performance.
* Best suited for analytical queries where slightly stale results are acceptable.

## Summary of the Program Concepts

This program introduced the **full data engineering lifecycle** and the foundational undercurrents that support it.

1. **Stakeholder-driven design:** Always work backward from business needs to technical requirements.
2. **Data ingestion:** Can be batch, micro-batch, or streaming, depending on system latency and volume requirements.
3. **ETL vs. ELT:** Choice depends on transformation complexity, hardware capabilities, and data volume.
4. **Transformation:** Cleaning, joining, modeling (e.g., star schemas) to make data usable for analytics or ML.
5. **Processing frameworks:** Use Pandas for small datasets; distributed frameworks like Spark for large-scale data.
6. **Serving models:** Warehouses for structured queries, lakes for ML and unstructured workloads, lakehouses for hybrid needs.
7. **Governance and trust:** Identity and access management, catalogs, testing tools (e.g., Great Expectations), and semantic layers ensure reliability.
8. **Automation and orchestration:** Terraform (infrastructure as code) and Airflow (workflow orchestration) operationalize pipelines.

The program emphasized **iterative design**, data quality assurance, and the growing convergence of warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses.

## Program Conclusion

Completing this program marks the start of a professional journey in data engineering. The boundaries between **software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning** are blurring as streaming systems, event-driven architectures, and cloud-based ML services mature.

Future trends include:

* **Simplified tooling and interoperability:** Abstractions that let engineers focus on high-value tasks instead of infrastructure.
* **Streaming-first architectures:** Real-time processing will become more common, though batch will remain relevant for reporting and training.
* **AI in workflows:** Coding assistants like GitHub Copilot can accelerate development but will not replace engineers. Instead, they will augment productivity.
* **Blended roles:** Software engineers will need deeper data expertise, while data engineers may integrate into application teams.

The field continues to evolve rapidly, but the principles of data engineering—scalability, trust, and user-centric design—remain timeless.
