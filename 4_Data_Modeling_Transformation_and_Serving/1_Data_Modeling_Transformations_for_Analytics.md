# Data Modeling and Transformations for Analytics  

### Structuring, optimizing, and transforming data to unlock analytical and business value  

Data modeling and transformation are critical stages in the data engineering lifecycle. After ingestion and storage, raw data must be organized into meaningful structures and reshaped to align with business logic, analytical use cases, or machine learning workflows. This chapter introduces the theory and practice of modeling data—covering conceptual, logical, and physical models—before diving into normalization, dimensional modeling, and key warehouse methodologies such as **Inmon**, **Kimball**, and **Data Vault**. It also examines more modern approaches like **One Big Table (OBT)**, and closes with hands-on demonstrations using **dbt** for practical transformations. Together, these approaches provide a toolkit for designing robust, efficient, and business-aligned data systems.

## Overview  

Data modeling creates structured representations of data that enable both human and machine decision-making. At its core, a data model defines **structure, relationships, and meaning**: which tables exist, how they connect, and what columns and attributes matter. Models serve dual roles—making data intelligible to people for analytics and dashboards, and meaningful to machines for automation and AI.  

Strong models reflect **business goals and rules** (e.g., blocking invalid payments), enforce **compliance**, and align processes like sales and inventory. They provide a **shared vocabulary** across engineers, analysts, and executives. Poor or absent models, by contrast, create silos, confusion, and unreliable insights.  

Historically, rigorous modeling was central to data warehouses. With the rise of big data, some teams abandoned it, leading to “data swamps.” Today, data governance and quality initiatives have re-emphasized its importance. Modern modeling can be targeted—for marketing, finance, or other domains—while still supporting enterprise-wide integration.

## Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Modeling  

Data models exist on a continuum:  

1. **Conceptual model** – abstract, high-level description of entities, their attributes, and relationships. Often visualized with **ER diagrams**.  
   - Example: Products ↔ Orders (one-to-many relationship).  
   - Focus: business logic, not technical details.  

2. **Logical model** – introduces technical structure (column types, primary/foreign keys). Still independent of specific technology.  

3. **Physical model** – specifies the actual implementation in a DBMS.  
   - Includes: partitioning, replication, disk vs RAM storage.  
   - Example: PostgreSQL schema with indexed foreign keys.  

The process moves from **abstract concepts** to **technical realization**, ensuring that business understanding translates into a concrete, efficient system.

## Normalization  

Normalization, introduced by **Edgar Codd (1970)**, reduces redundancy and ensures referential integrity in relational databases.  

### Goals:  
- Eliminate update, insertion, and deletion anomalies.  
- Simplify schema evolution when new data types are added.  

### Example: Sales Orders  

- **Denormalized form**: one giant table, customer info repeated in many rows. Updating one address requires many row changes.  
- **Normalized form**: customer data isolated in a `Customers` table; updates happen once.  

### Normal Forms:  
- **1NF**: eliminate nested data, ensure unique primary key.  
- **2NF**: remove partial dependencies (columns depending only on part of composite key).  
- **3NF**: remove transitive dependencies (non-key columns depending on other non-key columns).  

**Rule of thumb**:  
- Use **3NF** for transactional systems → integrity, efficient writes.  
- Use **denormalized forms** for performance when frequent joins slow analytics.

## Dimensional Modeling - Star Schema  

The **star schema** organizes data to facilitate **analytical queries** and business comprehension.  

### Structure:  
- **Fact table**: quantitative measures (sales amount, trip duration, tip amount).  
- **Grain**: the level of detail (e.g., per ride, per customer per day).  
- **Dimension tables**: descriptive attributes (customers, drivers, locations).  

### Properties:  
- **Fact tables**: long and narrow, immutable, append-only.  
- **Dimension tables**: wide and short, contain descriptive metadata.  
- **Conformed dimensions**: reused across multiple star schemas.  
- **Surrogate keys**: substitute natural keys for consistency across sources.  

### Example Query:  

```sql
SELECT p.product_line, SUM(f.order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_orders f
JOIN dim_products p ON f.product_code = p.product_code
JOIN dim_locations l ON f.postal_code = l.postal_code
WHERE l.country = 'USA'
GROUP BY p.product_line;
````

This query illustrates **aggregation and filtering** using fact measures and dimensions. Compared with normalized schemas, star schemas simplify queries, reduce joins, and accelerate analytics.

## Inmon vs Kimball Data Modeling Approaches for Data Warehouses

Two dominant schools of thought for data warehouses:

### Inmon (1989, “Father of the Data Warehouse”)

* **Approach**: highly normalized warehouse → downstream star schemas in **data marts**.
* **Strengths**: single source of truth, minimal redundancy, long-term adaptability.
* **Use case**: when **data quality and integrity** are top priorities.

### Kimball (1990s)

* **Approach**: star schemas stored directly in the warehouse, data marts integrated.
* **Strengths**: rapid development, faster iterations, easier access for analysts.
* **Trade-off**: potential duplication and inconsistency.
* **Use case**: when **speed and practical insights** matter most.

**Hybrid reality**: many organizations use both, balancing consistency with speed.

## Another Modeling Example

Consider a **car rental company**:

* **Fact table (grain = one rental booking)**

  * Booking ID (primary key).
  * Business measures: booking fee, insurance fee, fuel charge, extra days, total cost.
  * Foreign keys: customer, car, store, date.

* **Dimension tables**

  * `dim_customers`: customer details (license, address).
  * `dim_cars`: car details (VIN, model, brand).
  * `dim_dates`: temporal details (day, week, month, quarter).
  * `dim_stores`: location details (city, state, ZIP).

This schema supports questions like: *What are peak booking times? Which cars are most popular? How should pricing adjust by demand?*

## Data Vault

Introduced by **Dan Linstedt (1990s)**, Data Vault separates **business keys** from **descriptive attributes** to improve scalability and adaptability.

### Three Layers:

1. **Staging**: raw data, insert-only.
2. **Enterprise Data Warehouse**: hubs, links, satellites.
3. **Information Delivery**: downstream marts, often star schemas.

### Core Components:

* **Hubs**: unique business keys (Customer ID, Order ID).
* **Links**: relationships/events between hubs (Customer ↔ Order).
* **Satellites**: descriptive attributes (customer name, order amount).

Advantages:

* Flexibility: easily adapt to business changes (new entities or relationships).
* Traceability: lineage back to sources.
* Scalability: modular extension.

Data Vault trades complexity for adaptability, making it suitable for evolving enterprises.

## One Big Table

**One Big Table (OBT)** is a modern, pragmatic alternative. Instead of normalization, all relevant attributes are denormalized into a **single wide table** (often with thousands of columns).

### Characteristics:

* Built on columnar storage (Parquet, BigQuery, Snowflake).
* Highly denormalized → no joins required.
* Supports nested data (arrays, structs).
* Typically sparse: many null values across columns.

### Benefits:

* Faster analytical queries (no joins).
* Simplified access for analysts.
* Leverages cheap cloud storage and efficient columnar queries.

### Trade-offs:

* Business logic may be obscured.
* Complex structures (arrays) have poor update performance.
* Risks of losing semantic clarity.

**Use case**: when speed and flexibility matter more than rigor (e.g., exploratory analytics).

## Demo: Transforming Data with dbt (Part 1)

In practice, data models are implemented with tools like **dbt (Data Build Tool)**.

### Setup:

* **Environment**: dbt Core (CLI) or dbt Cloud (hosted).
* Install adapters (e.g., `dbt-postgres`).
* Initialize a project with `dbt init project_name`.

### Project Structure:

* `models/`: SQL files defining new tables or views.
* `schema.yml`: metadata, documentation, and tests.
* `macros/`, `snapshots/`, `seeds/`: optional advanced features.

Example configuration (`profiles.yml` for Postgres):

```yaml
dbt_tutorial:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      user: my_user
      password: my_password
      port: 5432
      dbname: my_db
      schema: star_schema
      threads: 1
  target: dev
```

**Key point**: dbt abstracts SQL models into a reproducible, version-controlled workflow, ensuring consistency across environments.

## Demo: Transforming Data with dbt (Part 2)

### Steps:

1. Create SQL models (`dim_stores.sql`, `fact_orders.sql`).
2. Document with `schema.yml` (descriptions, column tests, uniqueness, not-null).
3. Configure `dbt_project.yml` (materialization: `table` or `view`).
4. Run models:

```bash
dbt run -s star_schema_models
```

5. Validate with built-in tests:

```bash
dbt test
```

dbt also supports **surrogate key generation**, **date dimension creation**, and **lineage visualization**.

The outcome: a fully materialized **star schema** built from normalized staging data, with documentation and tests embedded into the workflow.

## Conclusion

Data modeling and transformation are the linchpins of turning raw data into business-ready insights. Conceptual, logical, and physical models provide a systematic progression from abstraction to implementation. Techniques like **normalization** ensure integrity, while **star schemas** optimize analytics. Competing warehouse philosophies (Inmon vs Kimball) balance rigor and speed, and **Data Vault** adds scalability and lineage. Meanwhile, **One Big Table** embraces denormalization for performance in modern columnar databases. Tools like **dbt** bring these concepts into practice, enabling reproducible, documented, and testable transformations. Mastery of these methods empowers data engineers to deliver reliable, actionable, and scalable analytical systems.
