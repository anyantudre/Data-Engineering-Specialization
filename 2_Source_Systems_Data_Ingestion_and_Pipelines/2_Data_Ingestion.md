# Data Ingestion  
*Exploring batch and streaming ingestion, change data capture, and the practical implementation of ingestion pipelines in cloud environments.*  

---

## Introduction  
This chapter focuses on **data ingestion**, the process of moving data from diverse source systems into analytical or operational environments. Data ingestion is a crucial step in the data engineering lifecycle, bridging the gap between raw data production and downstream analytics, dashboards, or machine learning. The chapter compares **batch ingestion** (periodic, bulk transfers) with **streaming ingestion** (continuous, real-time flows) and introduces specialized patterns such as **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. It also explores tools and services—particularly in AWS—that enable reliable ingestion, while addressing trade-offs related to latency, scalability, cost, and complexity. By mastering ingestion strategies, engineers ensure pipelines deliver timely, accurate, and business-relevant data.

## Overview  
Ingestion is the **second stage of the data engineering lifecycle**, following data generation and preceding storage and transformation. The chapter divides ingestion into two key paradigms:  
- **Batch ingestion** – data transferred at intervals, usually in files or tables.  
- **Streaming ingestion** – continuous data flows, often event-driven.  

Both paradigms coexist in modern systems, chosen according to latency requirements, cost, and infrastructure capabilities. The section also previews tools like **AWS Glue**, **Kinesis**, and **Kafka**, which provide ingestion flexibility across use cases.

## Batch Ingestion  
Batch ingestion collects and transfers data in bulk at scheduled intervals. Typical mechanisms include:  
- File-based transfers (CSV, JSON, Parquet).  
- Database dumps or exports.  
- API calls executed on schedules.  

**Advantages**:  
- Simplicity of implementation.  
- Cost-efficiency when latency is not critical.  
- Compatibility with large historical datasets.  

**Drawbacks**:  
- Delayed availability of fresh data.  
- Potentially large processing spikes at batch times.  

Batch ingestion is well-suited for **dashboards, historical reporting, and machine learning training sets**, where real-time updates are unnecessary.  

---

## Streaming Ingestion  
Streaming ingestion processes data **continuously and incrementally** as it is produced. Common use cases include:  
- Real-time fraud detection.  
- Personalized recommendations.  
- Monitoring and alerting.  

Streaming systems rely on **event-driven architectures** with producers, brokers, and consumers. Examples include:  
- **Kafka** – distributed streaming platform.  
- **AWS Kinesis** – managed streaming service.  

**Advantages**:  
- Low latency.  
- Enables real-time insights.  

**Drawbacks**:  
- More complex architecture.  
- Higher operational costs.  

Streaming ingestion is essential when organizations need to react quickly to events or customer actions.  

---

## Batch vs. Streaming Trade-Offs  
The choice between batch and streaming involves balancing:  

- **Latency** – streaming offers near real-time data; batch introduces delays.  
- **Complexity** – batch is simpler; streaming requires advanced infrastructure.  
- **Cost** – streaming often incurs higher compute and storage expenses.  
- **Use cases** – batch fits periodic analytics; streaming powers real-time applications.  

Many organizations adopt a **hybrid approach**, using batch for historical data and streaming for operational, real-time needs.  

---

## Change Data Capture  
**Change Data Capture (CDC)** is a technique to track changes in source databases and propagate them downstream. Instead of re-ingesting entire tables, CDC captures **inserts, updates, and deletes** in near real-time.  

**Benefits**:  
- Reduces processing load.  
- Provides up-to-date replicas of source systems.  
- Useful for microservices integration and real-time analytics.  

Implementation often relies on:  
- **Database logs** (e.g., MySQL binlog, PostgreSQL WAL).  
- **CDC tools** (e.g., Debezium, AWS DMS).  

CDC combines the efficiency of streaming with the consistency of database operations, making it central to modern ingestion patterns.

## AWS Glue Ingestion  
**AWS Glue** supports batch ingestion through ETL jobs. Key features:  
- **Serverless ETL** – no need to manage infrastructure.  
- **Data Catalog** – central metadata repository.  
- **Connectivity** – integrates with databases, S3, and Redshift.  

Glue allows transformations during ingestion, such as converting CSVs to **Parquet** for efficiency. It is ideal when teams prioritize **ease of use** over fine-grained control.  

---

## AWS Kinesis Ingestion  
**Amazon Kinesis** provides managed streaming ingestion services:  
- **Kinesis Data Streams** – real-time data ingestion at scale.  
- **Kinesis Data Firehose** – loads streaming data directly into storage like S3 or Redshift.  
- **Kinesis Data Analytics** – allows SQL queries on live data.  

Kinesis is AWS-native and user-friendly but offers less flexibility than open-source **Kafka**. It fits organizations prioritizing **real-time insights** without managing complex clusters.  

---

## AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) Ingestion  
**AWS DMS** specializes in migrating and replicating databases, often with CDC capabilities. It:  
- Supports homogeneous (e.g., Oracle → Oracle) and heterogeneous (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL) migrations.  
- Allows ongoing replication, ensuring target databases stay updated.  
- Facilitates cloud adoption by simplifying migrations from on-premises systems.  

DMS is a practical tool for building ingestion pipelines when source and target systems involve traditional relational databases.  

---

## AWS Data Migration Service Example  
A common use case is replicating a transactional database into a **data warehouse**:  
1. DMS extracts ongoing changes from the source database (via CDC).  
2. Data is ingested into **Amazon Redshift** or **S3**.  
3. Analysts and data scientists access near real-time replicas without impacting the production system.  

This pattern is widely used in e-commerce, finance, and any scenario requiring both operational continuity and analytical insights.  

---

## Conclusion  
Data ingestion is the lifeline of data engineering, enabling raw data to enter analytical ecosystems. Engineers must choose between **batch** and **streaming ingestion** depending on latency, cost, and complexity requirements. Techniques like **Change Data Capture** offer efficient middle ground solutions. AWS provides several managed services—Glue, Kinesis, and DMS—that simplify ingestion at scale, each with specific strengths. By understanding these paradigms and tools, data engineers can design pipelines that are both efficient and aligned with business needs.

## TL;DR  
Data ingestion moves data from source systems to target environments. Options include **batch ingestion** (periodic bulk loads), **streaming ingestion** (real-time data), and **CDC** (efficient change tracking). AWS services like **Glue**, **Kinesis**, and **DMS** provide scalable ingestion solutions.
