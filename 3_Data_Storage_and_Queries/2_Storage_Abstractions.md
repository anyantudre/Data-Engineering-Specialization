# Storage Abstractions  
*From data warehouses to lakehouses: understanding the evolution of modern storage systems*  

---

## Chapter Summary  
Storage abstractions are fundamental to modern data engineering. They define how organizations ingest, manage, and analyze data across different workloads. This chapter traces the evolution from traditional data warehouses to modern cloud warehouses, then to data lakes, and finally to lakehouses—architectures that combine the strengths of both paradigms. Along the way, it introduces key concepts such as schema-on-read, massively parallel processing (MPP), and open table formats like Delta Lake and Iceberg. By comparing these systems, the chapter equips data engineers with the knowledge to design scalable, cost-effective, and business-aligned storage solutions.

## Data Warehouse - Key Architectural Ideas  
A **data warehouse (DW)** was introduced in the late 1980s by Bill Inmon to address the inefficiencies of running analytics directly on OLTP (transactional) systems. He defined a DW as:  

> “A subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions.”  

- **Subject-oriented**: Organized by business domains (e.g., customers, products, sales).  
- **Integrated**: Data from multiple sources stored in a consistent schema.  
- **Non-volatile**: Data is read-only; historical snapshots are preserved.  
- **Time-variant**: Supports historical and trend analysis.  

### Architecture  
- Data is ingested via **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipelines.  
- Data marts refine subsets of data warehouses for specific departments.  
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** enables incremental updates.  

Initially built on monolithic servers, warehouses struggled to scale. With the rise of **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)** in the 1990s, performance improved, but complexity remained. Cloud-native warehouses like **Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake** later revolutionized the model by separating compute from storage and making MPP elastic and cost-efficient.

## Modern Cloud Data Warehouses  
Cloud warehouses improve on traditional systems through:  

- **Elastic scaling**: Compute clusters can be spun up or down on demand.  
- **MPP architecture**: Queries are distributed across leader nodes, compute nodes, and node slices.  
- **ELT support**: Raw data is loaded first, then transformed inside the warehouse using its processing power.  
- **Columnar storage & compression**: Boost analytical query performance.  
- **Separation of compute and storage**: Independent scaling of resources for cost optimization.  
- **Object storage integration**: Virtually unlimited capacity.  

This makes cloud warehouses both powerful and flexible, but they are less suited to unstructured data like images or audio—enter the data lake paradigm.

## Data Lakes - Key Architectural Ideas  
A **data lake** emerged in the 2000s as a central repository for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale. It uses **schema-on-read**, meaning structure is applied only when data is queried.  

- **Storage foundation**: Typically object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Hadoop HDFS).  
- **Processing**: Engines like MapReduce, Spark, or Hive.  
- **Advantages**: Low-cost, scalable storage for diverse data types.  
- **Challenges**: Without governance, data lakes often degrade into **data swamps**—disorganized, unreliable repositories.  

Data Lake 1.0 lacked schema enforcement, data catalogs, and easy data manipulation, making compliance (e.g., GDPR deletions) difficult. Still, tech giants like Netflix and Facebook leveraged them for machine learning and exploratory analysis.  

---

## Next-Generation Data Lakes  
Modern data lakes address earlier shortcomings through:  

- **Data zones**: Raw (landing), cleaned (transformed), and curated (enriched) layers.  
- **Open file formats**: Parquet, Avro, ORC for efficient storage and broad tool compatibility.  
- **Partitioning**: Splitting data into smaller subsets (e.g., by date) to speed queries.  
- **Data catalogs**: Metadata repositories for discoverability, governance, and schema tracking.  

These improvements make lakes more manageable but often require integration with data warehouses for low-latency queries, introducing costly ETL pipelines. This gap led to the rise of the **lakehouse**.  

---

## The Data Lakehouse Architecture  
A **lakehouse** combines the low-cost scalability of lakes with the structured management of warehouses.  

Key features:  
- **Single storage layer** on object storage with medallion architecture (Bronze = raw, Silver = cleaned, Gold = curated).  
- **ACID compliance**: Reliable transactions with concurrent read/write support.  
- **Schema enforcement & evolution**: Quality control with flexibility for changes.  
- **Governance**: Access controls, auditing, lineage tracking.  
- **Time travel**: Query historical snapshots of data.  
- **SQL compatibility**: Allows both analytics and ML workloads.  

Lakehouses unify workloads, reducing duplication and ETL complexity while ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## Data Lakehouse Implementation  
Lakehouses are implemented using **open table formats**:  

- **Delta Lake (Databricks)**  
- **Apache Iceberg**  
- **Apache Hudi**  

These formats add transactional features, schema evolution, and time travel to object storage.  

### Example: Iceberg Architecture  
1. **Storage layer**: Data files (e.g., Parquet).  
2. **Metadata layer**: Manages manifests, partitioning, schema, and snapshots.  
3. **Catalog**: Points to the most current metadata file for each table.  

Queries access only relevant files, improving performance. Open formats also allow interoperability across engines, preventing vendor lock-in.

## Lakehouse Architecture on AWS  
AWS enables lakehouses using a layered architecture:  

- **Ingestion**: Services like Kinesis, Firehose, DataSync, and DMS.  
- **Storage**: Combination of S3 (raw/semi-structured/unstructured) and Redshift (structured curated data).  
- **Processing**: Glue, EMR, Flink, Redshift SQL.  
- **Catalog**: Lake Formation + Glue for metadata and fine-grained access control.  
- **Consumption**: SageMaker (ML), QuickSight (BI), Athena and Redshift Spectrum (SQL queries).  

Lake Formation simplifies permissions, cataloging, and ingestion, while Redshift Spectrum bridges S3 and Redshift for unified querying without ETL pipelines.  

---

## Implementing a Lakehouse on AWS  
Implementation focuses on integrating S3 and Redshift:  

- **Dual storage**: S3 for raw/large datasets; Redshift for curated, structured analytics.  
- **Redshift Spectrum**: Queries S3 data directly from Redshift without ETL.  
- **Athena**: Serverless SQL queries on S3 with pay-per-query cost efficiency.  
- **Glue + Lake Formation**: Automate metadata cataloging, schema tracking, and access control.  
- **Iceberg integration**: Supports schema evolution and time travel in AWS catalogs.  

This architecture reduces latency, avoids duplication, and provides flexible analytics across structured and unstructured data.

## Summary  
The evolution from **data warehouses → cloud warehouses → data lakes → lakehouses** reflects the growing demand for scalable, cost-effective, and flexible storage abstractions. Warehouses excel at structured, low-latency queries but are costly at scale. Lakes are cheap and flexible but risk becoming swamps without governance. Lakehouses unify these strengths, providing both robust data management and support for diverse analytics and ML workloads. With open table formats and cloud-native services like AWS Redshift Spectrum and Lake Formation, lakehouses are increasingly becoming the default architecture for modern organizations.  

---

## TL;DR  
Data warehouses optimize structured analytics, data lakes store diverse data cheaply, and lakehouses merge both worlds. With features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and SQL compatibility, lakehouses represent the future of unified, scalable, and business-driven storage.
