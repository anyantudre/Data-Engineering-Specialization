## High Level Look at the Field of Data Engineering  
Data engineering has become indispensable in modern industries due to the digitization of communication, healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and education. The explosive growth of data brings both opportunities and risks, making well-designed data pipelines essential for organizational success.  

Companies often begin with data scientists to drive analytics or build machine learning systems. However, many soon realize the absence of a foundational infrastructure to support these efforts. This gap has driven the demand for dedicated data engineers—professionals who can design and maintain the systems required for scalable, reliable data operations.  

---

## Particular Scenario  
Imagine a company eager to explore customer behaviors through analytics and machine learning. They hire a data scientist, who quickly discovers the necessary infrastructure is missing. Without ingestion pipelines, storage solutions, or transformation tools, the scientist is forced into building makeshift systems—work that falls outside their expertise.  

This common situation demonstrates why data engineers are essential: their role is to construct robust infrastructures so that data scientists and other professionals can focus on generating insights rather than firefighting foundational issues.  

---

## Recovering Data Scientist  
The term *recovering data scientist* reflects the experience of many professionals who transitioned into data engineering. In the mid-2010s, companies often hired data scientists without providing the necessary infrastructure or quality data to support their work. Many realized that the missing piece was not better models, but reliable data pipelines.  

Thus, some data scientists—initially hired to analyze—shifted toward engineering to build the systems that enabled meaningful analysis. This shift highlights the interdependence of data science and data engineering: one cannot thrive without the other.

## Data-Centric AI  
A **data-centric approach to AI** emphasizes improving data quality rather than solely refining algorithms. From small CSV files on personal machines to the trillions of tokens used to train large language models, the success of AI systems depends on well-prepared, reliable data. Data engineering ensures this foundation, enabling AI and machine learning systems to reach their potential.  

---

## Why You Should Always Start by Looking at the Big Picture  
Effective data engineering starts with aligning systems to business goals. Too often, engineers rush to select tools without understanding stakeholder needs. This leads to wasted resources, poor alignment, and fragile solutions.  

The first priority is to translate organizational goals into system requirements. Only then should tools and technologies be chosen. By maintaining a “big picture” perspective, data engineers avoid pitfalls and ensure their work drives measurable business outcomes.  

---

## How the Data Engineering Role Was Born  
In the early days, software engineers built applications, and the resulting data was seen as exhaust—a byproduct useful only for troubleshooting. Over time, organizations realized the intrinsic value of this data. As volumes grew and use cases expanded, engineers began designing systems specifically for data ingestion, transformation, storage, and delivery.  

This evolution marked the birth of the **data engineer**—a specialist focused on extracting business value from the ever-growing streams of data.

## What is Data Engineering?  
According to *Fundamentals of Data Engineering*:  

> “Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high quality consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.”  

In simpler terms: **data engineers turn raw data into usable information and make it accessible for analytics, machine learning, or operational use.** This involves integrating knowledge of security, orchestration, data management, and software engineering.  

---

## Data Engineering Lifecycle  
The lifecycle can be broken into several stages:  

1. **Data Generation & Sources**: Applications, sensors, or user inputs produce raw data.  
2. **Ingestion**: Data is collected and brought into pipelines.  
3. **Transformation**: Data is cleaned, structured, and reshaped.  
4. **Storage**: Data is preserved for access and use across stages.  
5. **Serving**: Data products are delivered to downstream consumers.  

End use cases—analytics, machine learning, or reverse ETL—derive value from these pipelines. Storage underpins all stages, emphasizing its central role.

## The Data Engineer Among Other Stakeholders  
Data engineers sit at the intersection of upstream and downstream needs:  

- **Downstream stakeholders**: Analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, marketers, executives—anyone consuming processed data.  
- **Upstream stakeholders**: Software engineers and system owners generating raw data.  

Strong communication ensures pipelines remain resilient to schema changes, outages, and compliance needs while serving actionable insights to consumers.

## Business Value  
Technology choices matter, but business value is paramount. As Bill Inmon noted: *“Go to where the money is.”*  

Business value can take multiple forms:  
- Increased revenue  
- Cost savings  
- Improved efficiency  
- Successful product launches  

Ultimately, value lies in perception: if stakeholders see your pipelines helping them achieve goals, your work as a data engineer is recognized as impactful.

## Requirements  
Every data project begins with requirements:  

- **Business requirements**: High-level objectives (e.g., grow revenue).  
- **Stakeholder requirements**: Individual needs to perform tasks effectively.  
- **System requirements**: Functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how it performs).  

Functional requirements might include ingesting real-time data; non-functional ones might involve latency or reliability constraints. Gathering and translating requirements ensures systems align with both business strategy and technical feasibility.  

---

## Translate Stakeholder Needs into Specific Requirements  
Key steps:  
1. Analyze existing systems and pain points.  
2. Identify stakeholder actions enabled by data.  
3. Validate understanding with stakeholders.  
4. Engage additional stakeholders as needed.  

Example: A marketing team needs real-time product sales by region but currently receives daily data dumps. A data engineer must design pipelines with real-time ingestion, transformation, and monitoring—while coordinating with source system owners about schema changes or disruptions.  

---

## Framework for Thinking Like a Data Engineer  
A practical framework follows four iterative stages:  

1. **Understand goals**: Clarify business objectives and stakeholder needs.  
2. **Define requirements**: Document functional and non-functional requirements.  
3. **Choose tools & prototype**: Evaluate trade-offs, test systems, and validate with stakeholders.  
4. **Deploy & iterate**: Build, monitor, and improve pipelines as needs evolve.  

This cyclical approach ensures systems adapt to changing goals and technologies.
